I want to talk about when you say NO to a journalist request. Because sometimes no is just as important as a yes.

So, I was asked to be on a podcast about theocracy (not naming the outlet) to be paired with someone who basically doesn't think America will become a theocracy,. I would be the person worried about it, obviously.

I said no. Because right now, where we are as a country after the SCOTUS decisions last month on abortion, Prayer, and vouchers for religious schools, what else is there to think but a theocratic turn?

But here's the thing. These kinds of requests, this "let's do both sides BS" actually tamps down the real existential threat to democracy. It also makes it seem that a liberal religious position that does not agree with these kind of encroachments are "fear mongering:"

So what's the lesson here? Do your research about the outlet. What voices do they privilege? What voices are add ons? In this case, there are a plethora of conservative religious voices,(and mostly Christian)  but a mere sprinkling of moderate or liberal religious ones.
